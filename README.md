Varsity Hackathon 2023 | V028 | Protege
Lack of career path exposure in undergraduate students occurred due to lack of exposure, resources and guidance. To address this issue, PROTEGE helps undergraduate students to expose themselves to how the working industry functions through career simulation. Not only that, but PROTEGE also provides the user with career insight and mentoring sessions so that they can have a deeper insight into which career they can venture into. With the assessment space and opportunity space provided, users can know which career suits them the best as well as information about which upcoming internships are offered and career fairs.
